# How to Create Presets

For create presets you need a `.json` file in `/presets` with any parameter who you want. 

> [!NOTE]
> The buttons don't appear locally. You might need help from a friend or use Discord Web with another account.

## Preset Example
````json
{
    "details": "By: Guhszvv",
    "name":"Sylo RPC",
    "assets": {
        "large_image": "https://i.pinimg.com/736x/e7/6b/4d/e76b4d04c0823a1513f62e575f9fbeea.jpg",
        "large_text": "Mikudayo"
    },
    "buttons": [{
      "label": "Sylo RPC",
      "url": "https://github.com/Guhszvv/Sylo"
    }]
}
